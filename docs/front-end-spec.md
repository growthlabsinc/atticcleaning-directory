**Entry Points:** Google search "attic cleaning near me", direct website access, educational article internal links

**Success Criteria:** User contacts business within 2 minutes of landing on site

- Slow internet: Progressive loading with skeleton screens, critical content first

**Notes:** Emphasize phone contact as primary CTA, minimize form friction

### Business Research and Comparison Flow

**User Goal:** Research multiple attic cleaning providers and compare services before contacting

**Entry Points:** Educational articles, specific service category pages, comparison searches

```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
