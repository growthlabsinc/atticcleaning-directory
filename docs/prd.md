### Background Context

The attic cleaning services market is highly fragmented, with homeowners struggling to find qualified specialists through generic home service directories. Current platforms like Angie's List and HomeAdvisor lack specialized categorization for attic-specific services, forcing users to navigate through general contractors who may not specialize in attic work involving health and safety concerns like asbestos, mold, and rodent contamination.

AtticCleaning.com addresses this gap by creating a niche-focused directory platform optimized for "attic cleaning" and "attic cleaning near me" searches. The platform combines comprehensive business listings with educational content, serving both homeowners seeking specialized services and attic cleaning businesses seeking qualified leads. This evergreen, location-based niche offers significant potential for passive income through SEO-driven organic traffic and display ad monetization.
