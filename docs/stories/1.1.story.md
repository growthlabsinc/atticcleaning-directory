## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story in the project.

### Platform Architecture (CORRECTED)
**Single Platform Strategy:** DigitalOcean only for cost control and simplicity
- **Hosting:** DigitalOcean App Platform for static site hosting
- **CDN:** DigitalOcean Spaces CDN for global delivery
- **Cost Target:** Sub-$50 monthly for sustainable profitability
- **Deployment:** Direct static file deployment from Git repository

### Performance Requirements
[Source: docs/prd.md#non-functional]
- Mobile page load times must be under 1.5 seconds First Contentful Paint for #1 SEO ranking potential
- Core Web Vitals must achieve Green scores: LCP < 1.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1 on mobile devices
- Platform must achieve 95+ PageSpeed Insights score on mobile for optimal SEO performance
- Total hosting and CDN costs must remain under $50 monthly for sustainable profitability

### Technical Constraints (PRD-COMPLIANT)
[Source: docs/prd.md#technical-assumptions]
- **Zero-Dependency HTML/CSS/JS:** No frameworks, libraries, or build tools - pure static files for maximum speed and minimal overhead
- **DigitalOcean CDN Integration:** Global CDN for sub-1-second loading worldwide, edge caching for static assets
- **Mobile-First Asset Optimization:** Critical CSS inlined in HTML, images optimized for mobile (WebP format)
- **Minimal JavaScript Strategy:** Essential JS only for search functionality, no third-party libraries

### File Structure (SIMPLIFIED)
```
/
├── index.html (homepage)
├── css/
│   └── styles.css (mobile-first styles)
├── js/
│   └── search.js (vanilla JavaScript)
├── images/
│   └── *.webp (optimized images)
├── data/
│   └── businesses.json (business listings)
└── pages/
    ├── states/
    └── cities/
```

### Deployment Strategy
- **Direct File Upload:** No build process, files deployed as-is
- **Git Integration:** DigitalOcean App Platform pulls directly from Git
- **Zero Build Time:** Instant deployments since no compilation needed
- **Version Control:** All content versioned in Git repository

### Testing Requirements (MOBILE-FOCUSED)
- Manual verification of domain accessibility over HTTPS on mobile devices
- PageSpeed Insights testing SPECIFICALLY for mobile performance (ignore desktop scores)
- Core Web Vitals validation using Google tools on mobile devices
- Geographic CDN performance testing from multiple locations using mobile simulation
- Test on slow 3G connections to verify real-world mobile performance

### Security Considerations
[Source: docs/prd.md#technical-assumptions]
- SSL certificates required for HTTPS (DigitalOcean managed)
- Content Security Policy headers for XSS protection
- No server-side vulnerabilities due to static-only approach

## Dev Notes

**Project Context:** This is the first story of Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure for AtticCleaning.com, a directory platform for attic cleaning services. The platform uses a pure static architecture optimized for mobile SEO performance.

**Critical Requirements:**
- Must maintain sub-$50 monthly hosting costs
- Performance targets: sub-1.5-second First Contentful Paint, 95+ PageSpeed score
- Mobile-first optimization for "attic cleaning near me" searches
- Zero-dependency approach (no frameworks/libraries/build tools)

**Platform Decision:** DigitalOcean-only architecture for cost control and simplicity. No Vercel, no Astro, no build tools - pure static HTML/CSS/JS files deployed directly.

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] Manual Testing: Domain accessibility, SSL verification, Core Web Vitals validation
- [x] Performance Testing: PageSpeed Insights mobile score verification
- [x] Integration Testing: Deployment pipeline verification with static files

Manual Test Steps (MOBILE-FIRST):
1. Navigate to atticcleaning.com on mobile device and verify site loads over HTTPS
2. Run PageSpeed Insights test using MOBILE tab and confirm mobile score ≥95 (ignore desktop)
3. Test Core Web Vitals using Google's Core Web Vitals checker on mobile (LCP < 1.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)
4. Test with Chrome DevTools mobile simulation and slow 3G throttling
5. Test deployment by uploading a sample HTML file and verifying automatic deployment
6. Verify CDN performance by checking mobile load times from different geographic locations
